## About the Video Course
This course will explore the Spring Framework and Spring Boot in depth. You’ll develop Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring REST applications, and much more starting from scratch! The list of technologies we cover in this course is huge. Covering everything with the Spring technology stack, combining all the technologies we learned, we will build a full-featured, production-grade Spring MVC CRUD application where we will use Spring Data, Spring REST, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap! So we will get a taste of UI and frontend development too with Spring.
